number of customer (according to Huff model) affect the decreasing of stock

The logistic provider equilibrate stock of warehouse :
	A batch does not follow a supply chain as now but go from a point to another and that's it.
	When a customer ask for a restock, the goods need to be already in a local warehouse.
	
Improve the behavior of logistic provider :
	They choose warehouse (purchasing or renting) according to their customer location. 
	They can choose :
		- the large warehouse according to his size and not necessarily his location in space
		- the local warehouse according to his location and not necessarily his size
		- the average warehouse according to this formulae :Let ->AB the vector between the local warehouse and the average one.
			Let ->CB the vector between the large warehouse and the average one.
			We try to find B which minimize ||(->AB) + (->CB)||.
