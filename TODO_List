stockInRoads must be unbundle by type of batch for data on file

Size of building affect break bulk time

The speed and length of must be considered to compute shortest path. But The maximum speed on a road must also affect the speed of the batch 
agent.

add a graphic with average distance traveled by batch (and kind of batch).

When a final dest manager change of logistic provider, his associated supply chain must be removed too

The batch could let a trace of their path and we could analyze the flows on Graphstream.

The probability to change the logistic provider must depend on his performance.

make a new algo to compute shortest path: need to consider the break bulks time and not just the length or the speed (useful if we had river 
network or rail network which are more fast in the transport but not with break bulk).

Add river network
add rail network
Add a zoomed window of "ile de france"
Add type of goods
