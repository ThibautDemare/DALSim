number of customer (according to Huff model) affect the decreasing of stock => done

Add something (a color for instance) to locate the node in graphstream => done

The surface of a building must affect the maximum quantity of a stock => done

Add graphic with number of batch, quantity of goods on road (perhaps in warehouses and shops too) => done 

The logistic provider equilibrate stock of warehouse :
	A batch does not follow a supply chain like now but go from a point to another and that's it.
	When a customer ask for a restock, the goods need to be already in a local warehouse. => done

Make a connection with graphstream to build a graph of the supply chains :
	node = warehouse, final dest and provider
	edge = this building deliver this other building in the supply chain
	=> done
	
The road network could be send to Graphstream. => done

Improve the behavior of logistic provider :
	They choose warehouse (purchasing or renting) according to their customer location. 
	They can choose :
		- the large warehouse according to his size and not necessarily his location in space
		- the local warehouse according to his location and not necessarily his size
		- the average warehouse according to this formulae :Let ->AB the vector between the local warehouse and the average one.
			Let ->CB be the vector between the large warehouse and the average one.
			We try to find B which minimize ||(->AB) + (->CB)||.
	=> done

Data of the graphic must be saved on a CSV file => done

stockInRoads must be unbundle by type of batch for data on file => done

When a final dest manager change of logistic provider, his associated supply chain must be removed too = done

A stock and a supply chain belong to a FinalDestinationManager. Need to update in consequences the management of warehouse according to this method.
Moreover, when a FinalDest change of LogisticProvider, the LogisticProvider need to update in consequences the usedWarehouses list.
When the LogisticProvider test if an order is needed, he must find the right supply chain

update supply chain network when logistic provider loose a final dest manager

Develop a new "move" skills with these functions :
	- The speed and length of Road must be considered to compute shortest path. But The maximum speed on a road must also affect the speed of the batch agent when he moves.
	- make a new algo to compute shortest path: need to consider the break bulks time and not just the length or the speed (useful if we had river network or rail network which are more fast in the 
	  transport but not with break bulk).
	- The batch let a trace on the path when he moves which allow to analyze the flows on Graphstream.
	- Add an easy way to make a graphic with average distance traveled by batch (and by kind of batch).
