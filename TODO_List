Size of building affect break bulk time

Develop a new "move" skills with these functions :
	- The speed and length of Road must be considered to compute shortest path. But The maximum speed on a road must also affect the speed of the batch agent when he moves.
	- make a new algo to compute shortest path: need to consider the break bulks time and not just the length or the speed (useful if we had river 
	- The batch let a trace on the path when he moves which allow to analyze the flows on Graphstream.
	- Add an easy way to make a graphic with average distance traveled by batch (and by kind of batch).

The probability to change the logistic provider must depend on his performance.
