number of customer (according to Huff model) affect the decreasing of stock

Add something (a color for instance) to locate the node in graphstream

Size of building affect break bulk time

The speed and length of must be considered to compute shortest path. But The maximum speed on a road must also affect the speed of the batch 
agent.

The surface of a building must affect the maximum quantity of a stock.

The logistic provider equilibrate stock of warehouse :
	A batch does not follow a supply chain like now but go from a point to another and that's it.
	When a customer ask for a restock, the goods need to be already in a local warehouse.
	
Improve the behavior of logistic provider :
	They choose warehouse (purchasing or renting) according to their customer location. 
	They can choose :
		- the large warehouse according to his size and not necessarily his location in space
		- the local warehouse according to his location and not necessarily his size
		- the average warehouse according to this formulae :Let ->AB the vector between the local warehouse and the average one.
			Let ->CB the vector between the large warehouse and the average one.
			We try to find B which minimize ||(->AB) + (->CB)||.

The road network could be send to Graphstream. So the batch could let a trace of their path and we could analyze the flows on Graphstream.

The probability to change the logistic provider must depend on his performance.

make a new algo to compute shortest path: need to consider the break bulks time and not just the lenght or the speed (useful if we had river 
network or rail network which are more fast in the transport but not with break bulk).

Add river network
add rail network
Add a zoomed window of "ile de france"
Add type of goods
