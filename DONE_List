number of customer (according to Huff model) affect the decreasing of stock => done

Add something (a color for instance) to locate the node in graphstream => done

The surface of a building must affect the maximum quantity of a stock => done

Add graphic with number of batch, quantity of goods on road (perhaps in warehouses and shops too) => done 

The logistic provider equilibrate stock of warehouse :
	A batch does not follow a supply chain like now but go from a point to another and that's it.
	When a customer ask for a restock, the goods need to be already in a local warehouse. => done

Make a connection with graphstream to build a graph of the supply chains :
	node = warehouse, final dest and provider
	edge = this building deliver this other building in the supply chain
	=> done
	
The road network could be send to Graphstream. => done

Improve the behavior of logistic provider :
	They choose warehouse (purchasing or renting) according to their customer location. 
	They can choose :
		- the large warehouse according to his size and not necessarily his location in space
		- the local warehouse according to his location and not necessarily his size
		- the average warehouse according to this formulae :Let ->AB the vector between the local warehouse and the average one.
			Let ->CB be the vector between the large warehouse and the average one.
			We try to find B which minimize ||(->AB) + (->CB)||.
	=> done

Data of the graphic must be saved on a CSV file => done

stockInRoads must be unbundle by type of batch for data on file => done

When a final dest manager change of logistic provider, his associated supply chain must be removed too = done
